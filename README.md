# FHoopz

This is just a toy project I made to play around with pandas using the excellent nba-api package.

I plan on running these scripts daily and uploading the reports to a public s3 bucket.

The system assumes you handle trades and roster moves elsewhere, just keep `data/fantasy/settings/rosters.json` up-to-date manually.

It'd be cool to have lambdas do all of this instead of doing it on my machine, but I'll get to that sometime in the future.
