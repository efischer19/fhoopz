Simple fantasy hoops using pandas and nba-api

Started out as just putting some stats onto my personal s3 bucket

Turns out I can get more of my buddies involved in fantasy if it's
just scoreboard-watching, so that slack bot now lives in this repo
as well.

The idea with the slack bot is that each playoff team from each
conference gets 10 points for 1st, 9 for 2nd, etc; so we can
draft IRL teams and see whose fantasy meta-team wins at EoY.
